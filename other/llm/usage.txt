# Simplifying the report of questions and answers into a text format
report_simple = """
1. Question: "readxl docs r"
   Response: This response was skipped.

2. Question: "save xlsx file using this package"
   Response: This response was skipped.

3. Question: "given a cell value in a df how to find the exact row number"
   Response: This response was skipped.

4. Question: "is this compatible with tidyverse or should I just use base r functionality"
   Response: This response was skipped.

5. Question: "I have a df where the rows should be columns and columns should be rows how do I flip it"
   Response: You can use the `t()` function in R to transpose the rows and columns of a dataframe. For a tibble or dataframe, use:

   df_transposed <- t(df)

6. Question: "how switch from df or tibble to matrix"
   Response: You can convert a dataframe or tibble to a matrix using the `as.matrix()` function in base R:

   matrix_data <- as.matrix(df)

7. Question: "line check if sub in substring in r"
   Response: You can check if a substring is present within a string using `grepl()` in base R:

   grepl("substring", "your string")

8. Question: "I have a column with variables like this c('some ignorable string', 'some digit') how to make it so that the column is only 'some digit' use tidyverse"
   Response: If you want to extract the digits from a column, you can use `stringr::str_extract()` from the tidyverse to extract the numeric part:

   library(dplyr)
   library(stringr)

   df <- df %>%
     mutate(new_column = str_extract(column_name, "\\d+"))

9. Question: "no there is no comma in the string"
   Response: This response was skipped.

10. Question: "no it's like this c('name', 'num')"
    Response: This response was skipped.

11. Question: "table joins in r"
   Response: You can join two tables in R using `dplyr::left_join()`, `inner_join()`, `right_join()`, or `full_join()`.

12. Question: "can you join more than two table at once with these functions or are multiple function calls needed"
    Response: To join more than two tables, you will need to use multiple function calls, chaining them with `%>%` or using nested join functions.
    
13. Question: "how to create a table in markdown"
    Response: You can create a table in markdown like this:

    | Column 1 | Column 2 |
    |----------|----------|
    | Data 1   | Data 2   |
    
14. Question: "What if I want to do a reverse table (like a transpose)"
    Response: To manually transpose a table in Markdown, rewrite the rows as columns and vice versa.

15. Question: "how switch from df or tibble to matrix"
    Response: You can switch a dataframe or tibble to a matrix in R with `as.matrix(df)`.

16. Question: "line check if sub in substring in r"
    Response: Use `grepl("substring", "your string")` to check for substrings.

17. Question: "how switch from bib citations style"
    Response: Modify how citations are called and the citation style used.
